### Option 2: Impact Focus
```
What if AI could schedule itself when the grid is green? 🌱

MCP Energy Hub gives AI agents real-time visibility into:
⚡ Grid carbon intensity
🔋 Renewable energy %
🏭 Data center energy use

Potential: 30-50% carbon reduction for flexible AI workloads!

### Option 3: Demo Focus
```
🎬 Demo: Carbon-aware AI scheduling with MCP

Ask: "Where should I run this training job?"

MCP Energy Hub responds:
✅ CAISO (California) - 180 kg CO2/MWh
⚠️ ERCOT (Texas) - 320 kg CO2/MWh  
❌ PJM (East Coast) - 420 kg CO2/MWh

Real-time data. Real impact. 🌍

🚀 Excited to share my submission for MCP's 1st Birthday Hackathon!

MCP Energy Hub is an enterprise MCP server that enables carbon-aware AI compute scheduling.

The Problem:
• AI compute is growing exponentially
• Data centers consume 1-2% of global electricity
• Most AI workloads run without awareness of grid conditions

The Solution:
• 8 MCP tools for real-time grid intelligence
• Live data from EIA covering 7 US grid regions
• Carbon intensity, renewable %, generation mix
• Smart recommendations for when/where to run compute

Key Features:
✅ Native MCP protocol support
✅ Real-time EIA data integration
✅ Beautiful Gradio UI
✅ Enterprise-ready API

Potential Impact:
If 10% of AI workloads shifted to low-carbon periods, we could save ~500,000 tons of CO2 annually.

Built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Gradio, and the MCP protocol.

## Demo Video Script (1-5 minutes)

### Intro (30 sec)
"Hi, I'm [NAME] and this is MCP Energy Hub - an MCP server for carbon-aware AI compute."

### Problem (30 sec)
"AI compute is exploding, but the grid isn't always green. What if AI agents could schedule workloads when renewable energy is high?"

### Demo (2-3 min)
1. Show Gradio UI
2. Check carbon intensity for ERCOT
3. Find best region for compute
4. Show MCP tools list
5. Call tool via API

### Impact (30 sec)
"With real-time grid visibility, we can reduce AI's carbon footprint by 30-50% for flexible workloads."

### Close (15 sec)
"Try it at [URL]. Built for MCP's 1st Birthday Hackathon. Thanks!"
